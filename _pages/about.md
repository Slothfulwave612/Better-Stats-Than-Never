# About

Hello everyone, this is Anmol Durgapal (*@slothfulwave612*). I have started this blog to share my notes on statistics. As I was revising the topic, I thought of making my notes open to everyone so that it becomes easy for everyone to learn and play around with statistics.

As a student what I have noticed is many of us found statistics hard to understand because sometimes it is the way we were taught the subject or sometimes we can't find better resources to learn it properly. You will find an overwhelming amount of resources on the internet. You will find some concepts explained intuitively on some YouTube videos and others on some blog posts (like on Medium) or sometimes in some books as well.  Keeping this on the mind, I went over the internet to find as many great resources as possible to make my statistics notes, and now think it's a good time to share these notes so that it can help those who are facing difficulties in understanding statistical concepts. 

In these blog posts, I will intuitively explain the concepts of statistics making use of various examples and will also demonstrate the practical use case of these concepts. 

# Prerequisites 

There are no prerequisites anyone can start as it's all from basic to advance. If you know [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)), then it's going to be a plus point for you as I will also be demonstrating how can one use Python to implement these statistical concepts.

*All these notes are either compiled from YouTube/Google or are my ideas.*

# How to Contribute

A plus point here is we can even edit these blog posts, so if you think you can explain a topic more intuitively, then you too can contribute to these blog posts. (so its a win for everyone)
