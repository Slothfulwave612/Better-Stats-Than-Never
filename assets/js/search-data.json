Data, Information and Knowledge . Data . Data is a collection of text, numbers and symbols with no meaning. . | It, therefore, has to be processed or provided with a context to make it meaningful. . | Example: . 161.2, 175.3, 166.4, 164.7, 169.3 (units in cm). . | Cat, dog, gerbil, rabbit, cockatoo. . | . | . Information . Information is the result of processing data. It enables the processed data to be used in a context and have a meaning. . | In simpler words, information is data that has meaning. . | If we put information into an equation with data, it will look like this: . Data + Meaning = Information . | Example: . 161.2, 175.3, 166.4, 164.7, 169.3 are the heights of the five tallest 15-year-old students in a class. . | Cat, dog, gerbil, rabbit is a list of household pets. . | . | . Knowledge . Knowledge is the state of knowing/learning something through the given information. . | If we put knowledge into an equation with information, it will look like this: . Information + Application or Use = Knowledge . | Example: . The tallest student is 175.3 cm. . | A lion is not a household pet as it is not in the list, and it lives in the wild. . | . | . Conclusion . Data is a collection of facts. Information is how you understand those facts in context. Knowledge is learning something from the given information. . Individuals and Variables . Defining The Terms . Individuals are people or objects included in a study. . e.g. five individuals could be five people, five records or five reports. | . | . A variable is a characteristic of the individual to be measured or observed. . e.g. age, time etc. | . | . Example . Example: Millions of Americans rely on caffeine to get them up in the morning.

A population is an entire group that we want to conclude. . | A sample is a small portion of the population. . | In research, a population doesn&#39;t always refer to people. It can mean a group containing an element of anything we want to study, such as objects, events, organisations, countries, species, organisms etc. . | . ## all imports are present at the start of the notebook def get_coord(): &quot;&quot;&quot; Function to get random coordinates.

Collecting data from a population . Populations are used when we have access to data from every member of the population. . | Usually, it is only straightforward to collect data from a whole population when it is small, accessible and cooperative. . | . Example: Collecting data from a population . A high school administrator wants to analyze the final exam scores of all graduating seniors to see if there is a trend. Since they are only interested in applying their findings to the graduating seniors in high school, they use the whole population dataset. | . | . For larger and more dispersed populations, it is often difficult or impossible to collect data from every individual. . For example, every ten years, the Indian government aims to count every person living in the country using the Indian Census. This data is used in many ways. But it is always difficult to collect data from the whole population. Because of non-responses, the population count is incomplete, and the data can be biased towards some groups. | . | In cases like this, sampling can be used to make more precise inferences about the population. . | . Collecting data from a sample . When our population is large, geographically dispersed, or difficult to contact, it is necessary to use a sample. . | We can use sample data to make estimates or test hypotheses about population data. . A hypothesis is a precise, testable statement of what the researcher(s) predict will be the outcome of the study. . | We will be learning more about hypothesis testing in future tutorials. . | . | . Example: Collecting data from a sample . We want to study political attitudes in young people. Our population is the 300,000 undergraduate students in India. Because it’s not practical to collect data from all of them, we use a sample of 1000 undergraduate volunteers from three Indian universities – this is the group who will complete our online survey. | . | Ideally, a sample should be randomly selected and representative of the population. . | . Reasons for sampling . Necessity: Sometimes it’s simply not possible to study the whole population due to its size or inaccessibility. . | Practicality: It’s easier and more efficient to collect data from a sample. . | Cost-effectiveness: There are a fewer participant, laboratory, equipment, and researcher costs involved. . | Manageability: Storing and running statistical analyses on smaller datasets is easier and reliable. . | . Population Parameter and Sample Statistics . Defining The Terms . When we collect data from a population or a sample, there are various measurements and numbers we can calculate from the data. . | A parameter is a measure that describes the whole population. . | A statistic is a measure that describes the sample. . | . Example . In our study of students’ political attitudes, we ask our survey participants to rate themselves on a scale from 1, very liberal, to 10, very conservative. . | We find that most of our sample identifies as liberal – the mean rating on the political attitudes scale is 3.2. . | We can use this statistic, the sample mean of 3.2, to make a scientific guess about the population parameter – that is, to infer the mean political attitude rating of all undergraduate students in India. . | . Notations . Population parameters are usually denoted by Greek letters. . Examples of population parameters are population mean ($ mu$), population variance ($ sigma^{2}$), and population standard deviation ($ sigma$). | . | Sample statistics are usually denoted by Roman letters. . Example of sample statistics are sample mean ($ overline{x}$), sample variance ($s^{2}$), and sample standard deviation ($s$). | . | . Questionnaire . Ques 01. Write an example showing the difference between data, information and knowledge? . Ques 02. 5, 10, 15, 20 are items of data. Explain how these could become information and what knowledge could be gained from them? . Ques 03. A report analysed a dataset of 77 breakfast cereals. Here is a part of the dataset. . pd.DataFrame( { &quot;Name&quot;: [ &quot;100% Bran&quot;, &quot;100% Natural Bran&quot;, &quot;All-Bran&quot;, &quot;All-Bran Extra Fiber&quot;, &quot;Almond Delight&quot;, &quot;Apple Cinnamon Cheerios&quot;, &quot;Apple Jacks&quot; ], &quot;Manufacturer&quot;: [ &quot;Nabisco&quot;, &quot;Quaker Oats&quot;, &quot;Kelloggs&quot;, &quot;Kelloggs&quot;, &quot;Ralston Purina&quot;, &quot;General Mills&quot;, &quot;Kelloggs&quot; ], &quot;Calories&quot;: [ 70, 120, 70, 50, 110, 110, 110 ], &quot;Sodium&quot;:[ 130, 15, 260, 140, 200, 180, 125 ], &quot;Fat&quot;: [ 1, 5, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0 ] } ) . .

            "content": ". Overview . Statistics is often hailed as one of the most useful areas of mathematics. . | It helps us to make educated guesses of the unknown, and find useful information in an ocean of data. But despite its usefulness, many people struggle with statistics: What is it? How does it work? Is it useful? . | For many statistics feels like an unending collection of rules and formulae. If its misapplied, statistics can lead to false conclusions, causing people to develop mistrust in the subject. . | In this tutorial we will get to know What statistic is? Why do we need it?, and How can it be useful? . | . What is Statistics? . Defining The Term . Statistics is the science of collecting, organising, analysing, interpreting and presenting data. . Let&#39;s now break down the definition to understand its meaning. . The most important thing is:it&#39;s all about data. Without data, statistics can not exist. | So the first step is to collect data. There are a lot of ways to collect data like conducting a survey or performing experiments and recording the obtained data. . | Once we have the data, the next step is to organise it, i.e. putting the data in some structured order like in a table. . | Now we have our data in an organised format, we then analyse it. Here we perform techniques like mean, median, mode or other advance techniques to get a sense of what the data is all about. . | Once we have the data analysed, we then interpret the data, i.e. what does the data tell us, and one very intuitive way to interpret the data is by visualizing it, where we present the data using some graphs or charts. . | . | So, in layman&#39;s term statistics is the science of learning from data. . | . Statistical &amp; Non-statistical Questions . In layman&#39;s term, the questions where we need statistics to conclude something are known as statistical questions and the questions where we don&#39;t need statistics to conclude something are known as non-statistical questions . | Lets first look at some examples, and then we will form a general definition. . Example 01: How old are you? . Here, we are talking about how old is a particular person. We don&#39;t need any tools of statistics here to answer this question. We can just ask the age. . | So this is a non-statistical question. . | . | Example 02: How old are the people who have watched a particular YouTube video in 2020? . Here, we are assuming that multiple people will have watched the video in 2020, and they are not going to be of the same age. There is going to be variability in their age. One can be of 10 years old others might be 20 and so on. . | What answer do we give here? Here we want to get a sense of in general, how old are the people? So, this is where the statistics might be valuable. We want to find here, let say an average age for this. . | So this is a statistical question. . | . | Example 03: Do wolves weigh more than dogs? . So once again here is variability in the weights of dogs and wolves. Some dogs are light, and some are heavy, same goes for wolves as well. . | Since we have variability in each of the categories, we might want to use statistics to answer this given question like finding an average and then comparing average to get an answer. . | So, this is a statistical question. . | . | Example 04: What was the difference in rainfall between Singapore and Seattle in 2020? . Now, these two numbers are known and can be measured. The rainfall in Singapore can be measured, as well as in Seattle, and then we can find the difference. . | So, we don&#39;t need statistics here hence it&#39;s a non-statistical question. . | . | . | Here is a pattern, in non-statistical questions we are asking about a particular individual. There is only one answer, due to which there is no variability in the answer. . | In statistical questions we are asking about a bunch of individuals, and there is a variability in the answer. So, we need statistics here to come up with some features of the data set to be able to make some conclusions. . | . The statistical question is one that can be answered by collecting data and where there will be variability in that data. . Where Do We Use Statistics? . Let&#39;s start by seeing where statistics are involved in our everyday life, and then we will see how statistics plays a significant role in many different fields. . | One familiar example we have here is how we manage our yearly or monthly budget. We go through how much money did we spent last year, what was the average money we spent, in which area we were spending the most, how much money did we saved? So all these questions come to our mind. It is only because of statistics and data we test out different things to save a little bit more money. . | Other examples in our daily lives can be: . We can use statistics to see how are we performing in our exams. . | It can help us see are we living a healthy life or not (by looking at what are we eating, how much are we exercising, what is our junk-food intake) . | We use statistics when we look at the weather forecast and decide what to wear. . | . | Other areas in which uses statistics heavily are: . Netflix uses it to predict what show we might want to watch next. . | Amazon uses it to recommend different products. . | Government use it to decide whether or not to invest more in child education or on any other sector. . | Statistics plays a very significant role in all the medical studies (from drug creation to cancer treatment). . | Stock market uses a statistical technique for stock analysis. . | . | So, in some way or other statistics play a very vital role in our lives, from solving our family budget problem to diagnosis and treatment of deadly diseases to helping businesses in increasing their profits. It helps us to understand the world a little bit better through numbers and other quantitive information. . Important: Statistics is the building block for Data Science. It is a necessary skill that any data scientist or analyst should have. Data scientists and analysts use statistics to find meaningful trends in the data, and it is only possible if one knows statistics and how to use it. . | . How Is Statistics Useful? . We are living in a world full of data, and its amount is progressively increasing day by day. Some form of data is present in almost every field and to understand the meaning behind the data, you need statistics. . | Statistical knowledge helps you use the proper methods to collect the data, employ correct analysis, and effectively present the results. . | It is a crucial process behind how we make discoveries, make decisions based on the data and make predictions. . | And allows us to understand a subject(be it medical science or sports) much more deeply. . | So to conclude no matter what field we are in our work will be involved with data in some form or the other, and it is good to know statistics which will help us to understand the problem a little bit better. . | . Questionnaire . Ques 01. Classify the following questions into statistical and non-statistical question. Also, explain the reason. . &emsp;&emsp;1.1. Do dogs run faster than cats? . &emsp;&emsp;1.2. Does your dog weigh more than that wolf? . &emsp;&emsp;1.3. Does it rain more in Seattle than Singapore? . &emsp;&emsp;1.4. In general, will I use less gas driving at 40 kmph than 50 kmph? . &emsp;&emsp;1.5. Do English professors get paid less than math professors? . &emsp;&emsp;1.6. Does the most highly paid English professor at Harvard get paid more than the most highly paid math professor at MIT in 2020? . . Ques 02. Data representing the heights of the students in a mathematics class is specified. Write down a statistical question you can answer using the data provided. . . Ques 03. Can you think of any other way(other than the listed examples in the above notes) you can use statistics in your daily life? . . Ques 04. Your college football(or any sport you want) coach wants his team to perform better in the upcoming tournament and ask for your help. Is there any way you can use statistics to help him out(given that you have data on the team&#39;s past performances)? If yes, then how? . 1.

          "content": ". Hello everyone, this is Anmol Durgapal (@slothfulwave612). I have started this blog to share my notes on statistics. As I was revising the topic, I thought of making my notes open to everyone so that it becomes easy for everyone to learn and play around with statistics. . As a student what I have noticed is many of us found statistics hard to understand because sometimes it is the way we were taught the subject or sometimes we can’t find better resources to learn it properly. You will find an overwhelming amount of resources on the internet. You will find some concepts explained intuitively on some YouTube videos and others on some blog posts (like on Medium) or sometimes in some books as well. Keeping this in my mind, I went over the internet to find as many great resources as possible to make my statistics notes, and now think it’s a good time to share these notes so that it can help those who are facing difficulties in understanding statistical concepts. . In these blog posts, I will intuitively explain the concepts of statistics making use of various examples and will also demonstrate the practical use case of these concepts. . Prerequisites . There are no prerequisites anyone can start as it’s all from basic to advance. If you know Python, then it’s going to be a plus point for you as I will also be demonstrating how can one use Python to implement these statistical concepts. . All these notes are either compiled from YouTube/Google or are my ideas. . How to Contribute . A plus point here is we can even edit these blog posts, so if you think you can explain a topic more intuitively, then you too can contribute to these blog posts. (so its a win for everyone) . If you want to contribute, you can reach out to me on Twitter or LinkedIn. .",
