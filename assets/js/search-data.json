Levels of Measurement . Defining The Term . The levels of measurement or scales of measurement is about how each variable is measured and how precise each variable is. | . Why Is It Important? . Businesses gather millions of numerical data every day, representing lots of items. . | For example, numbers represent dollar (i.e. costs of items produced), geographical locations of retail outlets, weights of shipments etc. . | All such data should not be analysed the same way statistically because the entities represented by these numbers are different. . | For this reason, business researchers need to know the level of data measurement represented by the numbers being analyzed. . | To conclude: The researcher needs to understand the different levels of measurement, as these, together with how the research question is phrased, dictate what statistical analysis is appropriate. . | . Different Types of Data . Data is divided into two different types: . Qualitative Data . | Quantitative Data . | | . Qualitative Data . We define qualitative data as the data that characterizes something. . | Also known as categorical data, this data type isn’t necessarily measured using numbers but rather categorized based on properties, attributes, labels, and other identifiers. . | For example:- . Name of an individual, Gender, State of origin, citizenship. . | A teacher gives the whole class an essay that was assessed by giving comments on spellings, grammar, and punctuation rather than score. . | . | Qualitative data is further divided into two types: . Nominal . | Ordinal . | . | . Nominal Data . We define nominal data as the data which don&#39;t have any order, i.e. we cannot put these data into a series such as from high to low or from fast to slow etc. . | Some of the examples: . Hair colour (e.g. Blond, Brunette, Black etc). . | Sex, religion, ethnicity. . | Zipcodes, place of birth. . | . | . Ordinal Data . We define ordinal data as the data which have a defined order, i.e. we can put these data into a series such as from high to low or from fast to slow etc. . | Some of the examples: . Satisfaction data points in a survey, where one = happy, two = neutral, and three = unhappy. . | Results of a race is another example of ordinal data, where first place, second place or third place shows what order the runners finished in. . | Order of class in a college (e.g. freshman, sophomore, junior and senior). . Tip: One way to remember these two terms is: Ordinal starts with O which means order and Nominal starts with No which means no-order. So, data which have a defined order is Ordinal, and the data which do not have any order is Nominal. . | . | . Quantitative Data . We define quantitative data as the data whose value is measured in the form of numbers or counts. . | Also known as numerical data, and is used to answer questions such as How many?, How often?, How much?. . | For example:- . Height of a person, Weight of a person, Temperature, Cost of something etc. . | High school grade points, number of pets, number of cousins you have etc. . | . | Quantitative Data is further divided into two types: . Discrete . | Continuous . | . | . Discrete Data . Discrete data is a whole number that cannot be divided or broken into individual parts, fractions and decimals. . | Example of discrete data: . The number of siblings you have. You can have two siblings or three siblings but not two-and-a-half siblings. . | The number of wins your favourite team gets is also a form of discrete data because a team can’t have a half win – it’s either a win, a loss, or a draw. . | . | . Continuous Data . Continuous data describes values that can be broken down into different parts, units, fractions and decimals. . | Examples of continuous data: . Height and weight . | Time - can also be broken down into half a second or half an hour . | Temperature is another example . | . | Continuous data is furthur divided into two pats: . Interval . | Ratio . Tip: Data is considered discrete if it can be counted and considered continuous if it can be measured. . | . | . Interval . Interval means space in between. . | Interval scales (or interval data) are numeric scales in which we know both the order and the exact difference between the values. . | The classic example of an interval scale is Celsius temperature because the difference between each value is the same. For example, the difference between 60 and 50 degrees is a measurable 10 degrees, as is the difference between 80 and 70 degrees. . | The limitation with interval scales is they don&#39;t have a true zero. . Absolute/true zero means that the zero point represents the absence of the property being measured (e.g., €0 means no money, 0kg means no weight). | . | There is no such thing as no temperature, at least not with celsius. In the case of interval scales, zero doesn’t mean the absence of value but is another number used on the scale, like 0 degrees celsius. . | Without a true zero, it is impossible to compute ratios. . | With interval data, we can add and subtract, but cannot multiply or divide. . Consider this: 10°C + 10°C = 20°C or 60°C - 20°C = 40°C, that&#39;s easy. . | But, 20°C is not twice as hot as 10°C, because when we convert 10°C to Fahrenheit, it is equal to 50°F and 20°C is equal to 68°C, which is not twice as hot. . | . | So, to conclude, interval scales are great, but we cannot calculate ratios. . | . Ratio . Ratio scales provide rankings, assure equal differences between scale values, and have a true-zero point. . | For example, the measurement of money is an example of a ratio scale. An individual with €0 has an absence of money. With a true-zero point, it would be correct to say that someone with €100 has twice as much money as someone with €50. . | Other examples of ratio variables include height, weight, and duration. . | Some variables, such as temperature, can be measured on different scales. While Celsius and Fahrenheit are interval scales, Kelvin is a ratio scale. . In all 3 scales, there are equal intervals between neighbouring points. However, unlike the Celsius and Fahrenheit scales where zero is just another temperature value, the Kelvin scale has a true zero (0 K) where nothing can be colder. . | That means that you can only calculate ratios of temperatures in the Kelvin scale. Although 40° is twice as many degrees as 20°, it isn’t twice as hot on the Celsius or Fahrenheit scales. However, in the Kelvin scale, 40 K is twice as hot as 20 K because there is a true zero at the starting point of this scale. . | . | . Questionnaire . Ques 01: Why should we classify data into different levels of measurement? . Ques 02: Many changes continue to occur in the healthcare industry. Because of increased competition for patients among providers and the need to determine how providers can better serve their clientele, hospital administrators sometimes administer a quality satisfaction survey to their patients after the patient are released. They ask following types of questions on such a survey. These questions will result in what level of data measurement? . &emsp;&emsp;2.1. How long ago were you released from the hospital? . &emsp;&emsp;2.2. Which type of unit were you in for most of your stay? . &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;□ Coronary case . &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;□ Intensive case . &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;□ Maternity case . &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;□ Medical unit . &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;□ Pediatric/children&#39;s unit . &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;□ Surgical unit . &emsp;&emsp;2.3. In choosing a hospital, how important was the hospital&#39;s location? . &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;□ Very Important, □ Somewhat Important, □ Not Very Important, □ Not At All Important . &emsp;&emsp;2.4. How serious was your condition when you were first admitted to the hospital? . &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;□ Critical, □ Serious, □ Moderate, □ Minor . &emsp;&emsp;2.5.Rate the skill of your doctor: . &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;□ Excellent, □ Very Good, □ Good, □ Fair, □ Poor . Ques 03: Classify each of the following as nominal, ordinal, interval or ratio data. . &emsp;&emsp;3.1. The time required to produce each tire on an assembly line. . &emsp;&emsp;3.2. The number of quarts of milk a family drinks in a month. . &emsp;&emsp;3.3. The ranking of four machines in your plant after they have been designated as excellent, good, satisfactory, and poor. . &emsp;&emsp;3.4. The telephone area code of clients in the United States. . &emsp;&emsp;3.5. The age of each of your employees. . &emsp;&emsp;3.6. The dollar sales at the local pizza shop each month. . &emsp;&emsp;3.7. An employee&#39;s identification number. . &emsp;&emsp;3.8. The response time of an emergency unit. . &emsp;&emsp;3.9.

            "content": "Tutorial 01: Getting Started With Statistics . Solution 1: . &emsp;&emsp;1.1. There are many dogs and many cats, and they all run at different speeds. Some dogs run faster than some cats, and some cats run faster than some dogs. So there is variability in the data we have. Hence, it is a statistical question. . &emsp;&emsp;1.2. We are comparing a particular dog to a particular wolf. We could put each of them in a weighing machine and come up with an answer. Hence, non-statistical question. . &emsp;&emsp;1.3. There is variation here. In some months it might rain more in Seattle, and other months it might rain more in Singapore. So, there is variability in the data. Hence, a statistical question. . &emsp;&emsp;1.4. It depends on the circumstances. It might be how recent an oil change happened, what the wind conditions are like, what the road conditions are like, exactly how you are driving the car - are you turning or going in a straight line, and so there is variation what the gas mileage is at 40 kmph and 50 kmph. Hence, a statistical question. . &emsp;&emsp;1.5. All English professors don&#39;t get paid the same amount, and all Mathematics professors don&#39;t get paid the same amount. Some English professors make quite well and some very little, same for Mathematics professors. There is variability in the data. Hence, a statistical question. . &emsp;&emsp;1.6. We here are talking about two particular individuals. We can find out how each of them gets paid in the year 2020. Now, as we have an absolute number, we can reach our conclusion. Here no statistics is required. Hence, a non-statistical question. . Solution 2: How tall are the students in the mathematics class? or What is the average height of the students in the mathematics class? . Solution 3: Think about this on your own!!! . Solution 4: It depends on the sport you pick. With different sports, you will tend to have different data. In football, you might have data like how many goals your team has scored or how many goals your team has allowed or data about assists of different players in your team etc. If you pick cricket, then you will have data regarding your batsmen or bowlers or maybe your fielders. Think about how can you use the data. It&#39;s a fun exercise. . Tutorial 02: Basic Terminologies In Statistics . Solution 01: (can be any other example as well) . &emsp;&emsp;Data: The number 10000 is a piece of data, as is the name John Paul. . &emsp;&emsp;Information: If we now say that John Paul is a teacher and $10000 is a teacher’s salary, the data is given meaning or context and makes more sense to us. . &emsp;&emsp;Knowledge: Building on the information. Knowledge can be John Paul is a teacher and he earns $10000 per year. . Solution 02: . &emsp;&emsp;Information: 5, 10, 15 and 20 are the first four answers in the 5 x table. . &emsp;&emsp;Knowledge: 6, 12, 18 and 24 are the first four answers in the 6 x table. (because the 5 x table starts at five and goes up in fives the 6 x table must start at six and go up in sixes) . Solution 03: . &emsp;&emsp;3.1. Breakfast cereals. . &emsp;&emsp;3.2. Manufacturer, Calories, Sodium, and Fat. . Solution 04: The 85 people. . Solution 05: Sample statistic. . Solution 06: . &emsp;&emsp;Population: All seniors at Riverview High. . &emsp;&emsp;Sample: The 100 seniors surveyed. . Solution 07: . &emsp;&emsp;Population: All classrooms in the elementary school. . &emsp;&emsp;Sample: The 7 classrooms selected. . Solution 08: . &emsp;&emsp;Population: All of the vehicles that pass through the lane with the camera. . &emsp;&emsp;Sample: The group of every tenth vehicle that passes through the lane. . Solution 09: . &emsp;&emsp;Population: All the parents of the paediatrician&#39;s patients. . &emsp;&emsp;Sample: The 10 parents of patients selected. . Solution 10. . &emsp;&emsp;Population: The threaded rods produced at the factory that week. . &emsp;&emsp;Sample: The the 40 threaded rods selected. . Solution 11. Sampling is done because you usually cannot gather data from the entire population. Even in relatively small populations, the data may be needed urgently, and including everyone in the population in your data collection may take too long. . Tutorial 03: Descriptive and Inferential Statistics . Solution 1: . &emsp;&emsp;1.1. Here, we want to know how strong the plywood is that we&#39;re producing and we determine whether the plywood is strong enough by looking at only out of every 100 sheets. So, we are sampling in this case. And we want to conclude something about the population (which is all the plywood we are producing). Hence, this is an example of inferential statistics. . &emsp;&emsp;1.2. Here, we are not sampling but looking at the entire group and summarizing the data using a bar-graph. Hence, an example of descriptive statistics. . &emsp;&emsp;1.3. The professor is looking at all the students in the course and summarising the data by finding the average. Hence, descriptive statistics. . &emsp;&emsp;1.4. We here are using a sample to conclude something about the population. Hence, inferential statistics. . Solution 02: . S.No Descriptive Statistics Inferential Statistics . 1 | Concerned with describing the target population. | Make inferences from the sample and generalise them to the population. | . 2 | Organise, analyse and present the data in a meaningful manner. | Test and predicts future outcomes. | . 3 | Describe the data which is already known. | Tries to make conclusions about the population that is beyond the available data. | . 4 | Tools - Measure of Central Tendency and Variability. | Tools - Hypothesis Test, Confidence Interval, Regression Analysis. | . Tutorial 04: Data-Measurement . Solution 1: First, it helps us decide how to interpret the data from the given variable. Second, it helps us decide what statistical analysis is appropriate on the values that were assigned. . Solution 2: . &emsp;&emsp;2.1. This question is about time measurement with an absolute zero and is therefore ratio-level measurement. (e.g. A person who has been out of the hospital for two weeks has been out twice as long as someone who has been out of the hospital for one week) . &emsp;&emsp;2.2. It yields nominal-data because the patient is asked only to categorise the type of unit he/she was in. This question does not require a hierarchy or ranking of the type of unit. . &emsp;&emsp;2.3. The question results in an ordinal-level data. e.g. very important might be assigned a 4, somewhat important a 3, not very important a 2, and not at all important a 1. Certainly, the higher the number, the more important is the hospital’s location. Thus, these responses can be ranked by selection. . &emsp;&emsp;2.4. ordinal-level, same logic as 2.3. . &emsp;&emsp;2.5. ordinal-level, same logic as 2.3. . Solution 3: . &emsp;&emsp;3.1. Ratio. . &emsp;&emsp;3.2. Ratio. . &emsp;&emsp;3.3. Ordinal. . &emsp;&emsp;3.4. Nominal. . &emsp;&emsp;3.5. Ratio. . &emsp;&emsp;3.6. Ratio. . &emsp;&emsp;3.7. Nominal. . &emsp;&emsp;3.8. Ratio. . &emsp;&emsp;3.9. Ordinal. .",

Descriptive Statistics . Defining The Term . In layman&#39;s terms, descriptive means seeking to describe. . | Descriptive Statistics is a term given to the analysis of data that helps describe, show or summarise data in a meaningful way. . | It helps us to simplify and describe large amounts of data sensibly. . | We take a group that we&#39;re interested in, record data about the group members, and then use summary statistics and graphs to present the group properties. . | With descriptive statistics, there is no uncertainty because we are describing only the people of items that we measure. We are not trying to infer properties about a larger population. . | The process involves taking a potentially larger number of data points and reducing them down to a few meaningful summary values and graphs. This procedure allows us to gain more insights and visualize the data. . | . Example of Descriptive Statistics . Example 01:- . If we have the results of all the students in a mathematics class, we may be interested in the overall performance of these students. . | We would also be interested in the distribution or spread of the marks. Descriptive statistics allow us to do this. . | . | Example 02:- . Consider you want to know how your college football team striker is performing in the current tournament. . | Your coach provides you with the data on the number of goals the player has scored in each match. . | You can summarize the whole data in the form of goal-average, another example of using descriptive statistics. . | . | Example 03:- . Many of the statistical data generated by businesses are descriptive. . | They might include the number of employees on vacation during June, the average salary at the London office, corporate sales for 2009, average managerial satisfaction score on a company-wide census of employee attitudes, and the average return on investment for the Lofton Company from 1990 to 2008. . | . | . Common Tools of Descriptive Statistics . Descriptive statistics frequently use the following statistical measures to describe groups: . Measure of Central Tendency: Using central tendency techniques (like mean and median) one can locate the centre of the dataset. This measure describes where most values fall. . | Measure of Variability: Also known as the measure of dispersion, describes how the data is spread in a distribution. We here use the concepts like variances/standard deviation, range etc. . Note: Do not worry about the jargons here, we will cover them in depth in future blog posts. . | . | . Inferential Statistics . Defining The Term . In layman&#39;s term, inferential means involving conclusions reached based on evidence and reasoning. . | Often, we do not have access to the whole population we are interested in, but only have a limited number of data instead (known as samples). . | Inferential statistics are the techniques that allow us to use these samples to make generalizations (forming general concepts or claims) about the population from which the samples were drawn. . | . Examples . Example 01:- . Suppose we conducted our study on test scores for a specific class (as in the first example of descriptive statistics section). Now we want to perform an inferential statistics study for that same test. Let’s assume it is a standardized statewide test. By using the same test, but now to draw inferences about a population. . | In descriptive statistics, we picked the specific class that we wanted to describe and recorded all of the test scores for that class (say, 8th-grade students). For inferential statistics, we need to define the population and then draw a random sample from that population. . | We need to devise a random sampling plan to help ensure a representative sample. Assume that we draw a random sample of 100 students from the defined population and obtain their test scores. . | Note that these students will not be in one class, but from many different classes in different schools across the state. . | When we have our samples ready, we then perform inferential statistic on it and based on the results we make our conclusion about the population. . | . | Example 02:- . One crucial use of inferential statistics is in pharmaceutical research. . | Some new drugs are expensive to produce, and therefore tests must be limited to small samples of patients. Utilizing inferential statistics, researchers can design experiments with small randomly selected samples of patients and attempts to reach conclusions, and make inferences about the population. . | . | Example 03:- . Market researchers use inferential statistics to study the impact of advertising on various market segments. . | Suppose a soft drink company creates a new advertisement and market researchers want to measure its impact on various age groups. . | The researcher could stratify the population into age categories ranging from young to old, randomly sample each group, and use inferential statistics to determine the effectiveness of the advertisement for the various age groups in the population. . | . | The advantage of using inferential statistics is that they enable the researcher to study effectively a wide range of phenomena without having to conduct a census. . | . Pros And Cons of Working With Samples . We gain tremendous benefits by working with a random sample drawn from a population. . | In most cases, it is simply impossible to measure the entire population to understand its properties. The alternative is to gather a random sample and then use inferential statistics to analyze the sample data. . | While samples are much more practical and less expensive to work with, there are tradeoffs. . | When we estimate the properties of a population from a sample, the sample statistics are unlikely to equal the actual population value exactly. . For instance, our sample mean is unlikely to equal the population mean exactly. | . | The difference between the sample statistic and the population value is known as sampling error. . | Inferential statistics incorporate estimates of this error into the statistical results. . | . Common Tools of Inferential Statistics . Inferential statistics frequently use the following tools:- . Hypothesis Tests . | Confidence Interval . | Regression Analysis . Note: I am not going to explain these concepts here because it will confuse the readers. We will follow a step-wise approach by first understanding the basics of descriptive statistics and then moving towards inferential statistics. In that way, it will be more intuitive and clear. . | . | . Conclusion . For descriptive statistics, we choose a group that we want to describe and then measure all subjects in that group. The statistical summary describes this group with complete certainty. . | For inferential statistics, we need to define the population and then devise a sampling plan that produces a representative sample. The statistical results incorporate the uncertainty that is inherent in using a sample to understand an entire population. . | . Questionnaire .

Data, Information and Knowledge . Data . Data is a collection of text, numbers and symbols with no meaning. . | It, therefore, has to be processed or provided with a context to make it meaningful. . | Example: . 161.2, 175.3, 166.4, 164.7, 169.3 (units in cm). . | Cat, dog, gerbil, rabbit, cockatoo. . | . | . Information . Information is the result of processing data. It enables the processed data to be used in a context and have a meaning. . | In simpler words, information is data that has meaning. . | If we put information into an equation with data, it will look like this: . Data + Meaning = Information . | Example: . 161.2, 175.3, 166.4, 164.7, 169.3 are the heights of the five tallest 15-year-old students in a class. . | Cat, dog, gerbil, rabbit is a list of household pets. . | . | . Knowledge . Knowledge is the state of knowing/learning something through the given information. . | If we put knowledge into an equation with information, it will look like this: . Information + Application or Use = Knowledge . | Example: . The tallest student is 175.3 cm. . | A lion is not a household pet as it is not in the list, and it lives in the wild. . | . | . Conclusion . Data is a collection of facts. Information is how you understand those facts in context. Knowledge is learning something from the given information. . Individuals and Variables . Defining The Terms . Individuals are people or objects included in a study. . e.g. five individuals could be five people, five records or five reports. | . | . A variable is a characteristic of the individual to be measured or observed. . e.g. age, time etc. | . | . Example . Example: Millions of Americans rely on caffeine to get them up in the morning.

Collecting data from a population . Populations are used when we have access to data from every member of the population. . | Usually, it is only straightforward to collect data from a whole population when it is small, accessible and cooperative. . | . Example: Collecting data from a population . A high school administrator wants to analyze the final exam scores of all graduating seniors to see if there is a trend. Since they are only interested in applying their findings to the graduating seniors in high school, they use the whole population dataset. | . | . For larger and more dispersed populations, it is often difficult or impossible to collect data from every individual. . For example, every ten years, the Indian government aims to count every person living in the country using the Indian Census. This data is used in many ways. But it is always difficult to collect data from the whole population. Because of non-responses, the population count is incomplete, and the data can be biased towards some groups. | . | In cases like this, sampling can be used to make more precise inferences about the population. . | . Collecting data from a sample . When our population is large, geographically dispersed, or difficult to contact, it is necessary to use a sample. . | We can use sample data to make estimates or test hypotheses about population data. . A hypothesis is a precise, testable statement of what the researcher(s) predict will be the outcome of the study. . | We will be learning more about hypothesis testing in future tutorials. . | . | . Example: Collecting data from a sample . We want to study political attitudes in young people. Our population is the 300,000 undergraduate students in India. Because it’s not practical to collect data from all of them, we use a sample of 1000 undergraduate volunteers from three Indian universities – this is the group who will complete our online survey. | . | Ideally, a sample should be randomly selected and representative of the population. . | . Reasons for sampling . Necessity: Sometimes it’s simply not possible to study the whole population due to its size or inaccessibility. . | Practicality: It’s easier and more efficient to collect data from a sample. . | Cost-effectiveness: There are a fewer participant, laboratory, equipment, and researcher costs involved. . | Manageability: Storing and running statistical analyses on smaller datasets is easier and reliable. . | . Population Parameter and Sample Statistics . Defining The Terms . When we collect data from a population or a sample, there are various measurements and numbers we can calculate from the data. . | A parameter is a measure that describes the whole population. . | A statistic is a measure that describes the sample. . | . Example . In our study of students’ political attitudes, we ask our survey participants to rate themselves on a scale from 1, very liberal, to 10, very conservative. . | We find that most of our sample identifies as liberal – the mean rating on the political attitudes scale is 3.2. . | We can use this statistic, the sample mean of 3.2, to make a scientific guess about the population parameter – that is, to infer the mean political attitude rating of all undergraduate students in India. . | . Notations . Population parameters are usually denoted by Greek letters. . Examples of population parameters are population mean ($ mu$), population variance ($ sigma^{2}$), and population standard deviation ($ sigma$). | . | Sample statistics are usually denoted by Roman letters. . Example of sample statistics are sample mean ($ overline{x}$), sample variance ($s^{2}$), and sample standard deviation ($s$). | . | . Questionnaire . Ques 01. Write an example showing the difference between data, information and knowledge? . Ques 02. 5, 10, 15, 20 are items of data. Explain how these could become information and what knowledge could be gained from them? . Ques 03. A report analysed a dataset of 77 breakfast cereals. Here is a part of the dataset. . pd.DataFrame( { &quot;Name&quot;: [ &quot;100% Bran&quot;, &quot;100% Natural Bran&quot;, &quot;All-Bran&quot;, &quot;All-Bran Extra Fiber&quot;, &quot;Almond Delight&quot;, &quot;Apple Cinnamon Cheerios&quot;, &quot;Apple Jacks&quot; ], &quot;Manufacturer&quot;: [ &quot;Nabisco&quot;, &quot;Quaker Oats&quot;, &quot;Kelloggs&quot;, &quot;Kelloggs&quot;, &quot;Ralston Purina&quot;, &quot;General Mills&quot;, &quot;Kelloggs&quot; ], &quot;Calories&quot;: [ 70, 120, 70, 50, 110, 110, 110 ], &quot;Sodium&quot;:[ 130, 15, 260, 140, 200, 180, 125 ], &quot;Fat&quot;: [ 1, 5, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0 ] } ) . .

            "content": ". Overview . Statistics is often hailed as one of the most useful areas of mathematics. . | It helps us to make educated guesses of the unknown, and find useful information in an ocean of data. But despite its usefulness, many people struggle with statistics: What is it? How does it work? Is it useful? . | For many statistics feels like an unending collection of rules and formulae. If its misapplied, statistics can lead to false conclusions, causing people to develop mistrust in the subject. . | In this tutorial we will get to know What statistic is? Why do we need it?, and How can it be useful? . | . What is Statistics? . Defining The Term . Statistics is the science of collecting, organising, analysing, interpreting and presenting data. . Let&#39;s now break down the definition to understand its meaning. . The most important thing is:it&#39;s all about data. Without data, statistics can not exist. | So the first step is to collect data. There are a lot of ways to collect data like conducting a survey or performing experiments and recording the obtained data. . | Once we have the data, the next step is to organise it, i.e. putting the data in some structured order like in a table. . | Now we have our data in an organised format, we then analyse it. Here we perform techniques like mean, median, mode or other advance techniques to get a sense of what the data is all about. . | Once we have the data analysed, we then interpret the data, i.e. what does the data tell us, and one very intuitive way to interpret the data is by visualizing it, where we present the data using some graphs or charts. . | . | So, in layman&#39;s term statistics is the science of learning from data. . | . Statistical &amp; Non-statistical Questions . In layman&#39;s term, the questions where we need statistics to conclude something are known as statistical questions and the questions where we don&#39;t need statistics to conclude something are known as non-statistical questions . | Lets first look at some examples, and then we will form a general definition. . Example 01: How old are you? . Here, we are talking about how old is a particular person. We don&#39;t need any tools of statistics here to answer this question. We can just ask the age. . | So this is a non-statistical question. . | . | Example 02: How old are the people who have watched a particular YouTube video in 2020? . Here, we are assuming that multiple people will have watched the video in 2020, and they are not going to be of the same age. There is going to be variability in their age. One can be of 10 years old others might be 20 and so on. . | What answer do we give here? Here we want to get a sense of in general, how old are the people? So, this is where the statistics might be valuable. We want to find here, let say an average age for this. . | So this is a statistical question. . | . | Example 03: Do wolves weigh more than dogs? . So once again here is variability in the weights of dogs and wolves. Some dogs are light, and some are heavy, same goes for wolves as well. . | Since we have variability in each of the categories, we might want to use statistics to answer this given question like finding an average and then comparing average to get an answer. . | So, this is a statistical question. . | . | Example 04: What was the difference in rainfall between Singapore and Seattle in 2020? . Now, these two numbers are known and can be measured. The rainfall in Singapore can be measured, as well as in Seattle, and then we can find the difference. . | So, we don&#39;t need statistics here hence it&#39;s a non-statistical question. . | . | . | Here is a pattern, in non-statistical questions we are asking about a particular individual. There is only one answer, due to which there is no variability in the answer. . | In statistical questions we are asking about a bunch of individuals, and there is a variability in the answer. So, we need statistics here to come up with some features of the data set to be able to make some conclusions. . | . The statistical question is one that can be answered by collecting data and where there will be variability in that data. . Where Do We Use Statistics? . Let&#39;s start by seeing where statistics are involved in our everyday life, and then we will see how statistics plays a significant role in many different fields. . | One familiar example we have here is how we manage our yearly or monthly budget. We go through how much money did we spent last year, what was the average money we spent, in which area we were spending the most, how much money did we saved? So all these questions come to our mind. It is only because of statistics and data we test out different things to save a little bit more money. . | Other examples in our daily lives can be: . We can use statistics to see how are we performing in our exams. . | It can help us see are we living a healthy life or not (by looking at what are we eating, how much are we exercising, what is our junk-food intake) . | We use statistics when we look at the weather forecast and decide what to wear. . | . | Other areas in which uses statistics heavily are: . Netflix uses it to predict what show we might want to watch next. . | Amazon uses it to recommend different products. . | Government use it to decide whether or not to invest more in child education or on any other sector. . | Statistics plays a very significant role in all the medical studies (from drug creation to cancer treatment). . | Stock market uses a statistical technique for stock analysis. . | . | So, in some way or other statistics play a very vital role in our lives, from solving our family budget problem to diagnosis and treatment of deadly diseases to helping businesses in increasing their profits. It helps us to understand the world a little bit better through numbers and other quantitive information. . Important: Statistics is the building block for Data Science. It is a necessary skill that any data scientist or analyst should have. Data scientists and analysts use statistics to find meaningful trends in the data, and it is only possible if one knows statistics and how to use it. . | . How Is Statistics Useful? . We are living in a world full of data, and its amount is progressively increasing day by day. Some form of data is present in almost every field and to understand the meaning behind the data, you need statistics. . | Statistical knowledge helps you use the proper methods to collect the data, employ correct analysis, and effectively present the results. . | It is a crucial process behind how we make discoveries, make decisions based on the data and make predictions. . | And allows us to understand a subject(be it medical science or sports) much more deeply. . | So to conclude no matter what field we are in our work will be involved with data in some form or the other, and it is good to know statistics which will help us to understand the problem a little bit better. . | . Questionnaire . Ques 01. Classify the following questions into statistical and non-statistical question. Also, explain the reason. . &emsp;&emsp;1.1. Do dogs run faster than cats? . &emsp;&emsp;1.2. Does your dog weigh more than that wolf? . &emsp;&emsp;1.3. Does it rain more in Seattle than Singapore? . &emsp;&emsp;1.4. In general, will I use less gas driving at 40 kmph than 50 kmph? . &emsp;&emsp;1.5. Do English professors get paid less than math professors? . &emsp;&emsp;1.6. Does the most highly paid English professor at Harvard get paid more than the most highly paid math professor at MIT in 2020? . Ques 02. Data representing the heights of the students in a mathematics class is specified. Write down a statistical question you can answer using the data provided. . Ques 03. Can you think of any other way(other than the listed examples in the above notes) you can use statistics in your daily life? . Ques 04. Your college football(or any sport you want) coach wants his team to perform better in the upcoming tournament and ask for your help. Is there any way you can use statistics to help him out(given that you have data on the team&#39;s past performances)? If yes, then how? . 1. Solutions↩ . 2.

As I was revising the topic, I thought of making my notes open to everyone so that it becomes easy for everyone to learn and play around with statistics. . As a student what I have noticed is many of us found statistics hard to understand because sometimes it is the way we were taught the subject or sometimes we can’t find better resources to learn it properly. You will find an overwhelming amount of resources on the internet. You will find some concepts explained intuitively on some YouTube videos and others on some blog posts (like on Medium) or sometimes in some books as well. Keeping this in my mind, I went over the internet to find as many great resources as possible to make my statistics notes, and now think it’s a good time to share these notes so that it can help those who are facing difficulties in understanding statistical concepts. . In these blog posts, I will intuitively explain the concepts of statistics making use of various examples and will also demonstrate the practical use case of these concepts. . Prerequisites . There are no prerequisites anyone can start as it’s all from basic to advance. If you know Python, then it’s going to be a plus point for you as I will also be demonstrating how can one use Python to implement these statistical concepts. . All these notes are either compiled from YouTube/Google or are my ideas. . How to Contribute . A plus point here is we can even edit these blog posts, so if you think you can explain a topic more intuitively, then you too can contribute to these blog posts. (so its a win for everyone) . If you want to contribute, you can reach out to me on Twitter or LinkedIn. .",
