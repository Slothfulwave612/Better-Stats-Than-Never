    "\n",
    "* A **frequency distribution** is an overview of all distinct values in the data set and the number of times they occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is a tool for grouping data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In a frequency distribution the data is presented in the form of **class interval** and **frequencies**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We define **frequency** in statistics as the number of times the observation occurred/recorded in an experiment or study.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * For example, if we record test scores of a class and recorded marks of 50 students, then our frequency will be 50.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The range of each group of data is called **class interval**.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * For example, we record the test scores of a class. The marks are between 0 and 100. We put these marks into groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * A class interval of 20 marks has these groups\n",
    "    \n",
