    "\n",
    "&emsp;&emsp;**1.4.** It depends on the circumstances. It might be how recent an oil change happened, what the wind conditions are like, what the road conditions are like, exactly how you are driving the car - are you turning or going in a straight line, and so there is variation what the gas mileage is at 40 kmph and 50 kmph. Hence, a **statistical question**.\n",

    "\n",
    "&emsp;&emsp;**1.6.**  We here are talking about two particular individuals. We can find out how each of them gets paid in the year 2020. Now, as we have an absolute number, we can reach our conclusion. Here no statistics is required. Hence, a **non-statistical question**.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Solution 4:** It depends on the sport you pick. With different sports, you will tend to have different data. In football, you might have data like how many goals your team has scored or how many goals your team has allowed or data about assists of different players in your team etc. If you pick cricket, then you will have data regarding your batsmen or bowlers or maybe your fielders. Think about how can you use the data. It's a fun exercise."
