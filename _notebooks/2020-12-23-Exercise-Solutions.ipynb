    "&emsp;&emsp;**1.1.** There are many dogs and many cats, and they all run at different speeds. Some dogs run faster than some cats, and some cats run faster than some dogs. So there is variability in the data we have. Hence, it is a **statistical question**.\n",
    "\n",
    "&emsp;&emsp;**1.2.** We are comparing a particular dog to a particular wolf. We could put each of them in a weighing machine and come up with an answer. Hence, **non-statistical question**.\n",
    "\n",
    "&emsp;&emsp;**1.3.** There is variation here. In some months it might rain more in Seattle, and other months it might rain more in Singapore. So, there is variability in the data. Hence, a **statistical question**.\n",
    "\n",
    "&emsp;&emsp;**1.4.** It depends on the circumstances. It might be how recent an oil change happened, what the wind conditions are like, what the road conditions are like, exactly how you are driving the car - are you turning or going in a straight line, and so there is variation what the gas mileage is at 40 kmph and 50 kmph. Hence, a **statistical question**.\n",
    "\n",
    "&emsp;&emsp;**1.5.** All English professors don't get paid the same amount, and all Mathematics professors don't get paid the same amount. Some English professors make quite well and some very little, same for Mathematics professors. There is variability in the data. Hence, a **statistical question**.\n",
    "\n",
    "&emsp;&emsp;**1.6.**  We here are talking about two particular individuals. We can find out how each of them gets paid in the year 2020. Now, as we have an absolute number, we can reach our conclusion. Here no statistics is required. Hence, a **non-statistical question**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution 2:** How tall are the students in the mathematics class? or What is the average height of the students in the mathematics class?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution 3:** Think about this on your own!!!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution 4:** It depends on the sport you pick. With different sports, you will tend to have different data. In football, you might have data like how many goals your team has scored or how many goals your team has allowed or data about assists of different players in your team etc. If you pick cricket, then you will have data regarding your batsmen or bowlers or maybe your fielders. Think about how can you use the data. It's a fun exercise."
