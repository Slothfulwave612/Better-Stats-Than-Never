    "\n",
    "    * Information is the result of processing data. It enables the processed data to be used in a context and have a meaning.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * In simpler words, information is data that has meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * If we put information into an equation with data, it will look like this: *Data + Meaning = Information*\n",

    "* **Knowledge**:\n",
    "    \n",

    "    * If we put knowledge into an equation with information, it will look like this: *Information + Application or Use = Knowledge*\n",

    "    * Example:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        * The tallest student is 175.3 cm.\n",
